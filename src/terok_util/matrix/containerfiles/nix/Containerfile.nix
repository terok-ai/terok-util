# Nix matrix slot.  Not a "distro" — the only goal is to reproduce a
# wrapped-Python setup so we can assert that ``[sys.executable, '-m',
# 'terok.cli.main', ...]`` re-entry still works (terok-ai/terok#717).
#
# We don't package terok as a Nix derivation; we just install it with
# pip inside a ``nix profile``-installed Python, which is enough to
# get the Nix wrapping behaviour on the interpreter.  Building a full
# nixpkgs derivation for terok-* siblings is a separate, much larger
# project.

# Pre-populate the system profile with what the tests need at runtime:
# wrapped python + pip and awk.  Bash and git-minimal already ship in
# the base image's profile; adding ``nixpkgs#bash`` or ``nixpkgs#git``
# here conflicts on shared files (``bash/printenv``, ``bin/git-shell``).
#
# No ``util-linux`` / ``shadow``: their ``su`` / ``runuser`` need SUID
# (configured via NixOS security-wrappers, which the bare ``nixos/nix``
# image doesn't ship).  ``run_nix_tests`` switches users via Python's
# ``os.setuid`` instead.  When the rootless-podman follow-up lands
# we'll add ``shadow`` for ``newuidmap``/``newgidmap``.
#
# ``--extra-experimental-features`` turns on flakes (off by default in
# nix 2.18-).
#
# ``nftables`` provides the real ``nft`` binary.  terok's shield requires
# nftables at runtime, so the unit suite (which constructs a real Shield
# via the task-runner code path) needs it present — the same as the
# podman matrix slots, which install nftables in their images.  Providing
# the real tool keeps the tests honest instead of stubbing it out.

# ``python312.withPackages(ps: [ ps.pip ])`` builds a wrapped python
# whose sys.path includes the listed packages — what we actually want.
#
# That expression isn't a valid flakeref attrpath (``profile add`` only
# parses dot-separated names there), so feed it via ``--expr``.

# skeleton on the bind-mounted ``/nix/store``), and an echo into
